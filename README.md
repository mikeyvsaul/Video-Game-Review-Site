# VGRDB The Videogame Community Review Site

VGRDB is a videogame database site whose primary purpose is to allow users with Google accounts to post their thoughts and reviews on any video game they want. Multiple users can add reviews to the same videogame, and if the videogame is not listed, they can add a game to the site. Adding a game to the site requires knowing the title of the game as well as having a review or thought at least 200 characters long. Users can only add one review per game, but they can always edit or delete their review at any time.

Visitors to the site can browse the current games and all reviews without the need to log in.

I chose to make a videogame review site because I love talking about videogames and the industry at large. The video games that are currently in the database are games I either play constantly or left a lasting impression.
